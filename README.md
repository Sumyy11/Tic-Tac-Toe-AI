# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
PROJECT: Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent with Minimax Algorithm

OVERVIEW: Developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an advanced AI agent using the Minimax algorithm to provide an intelligent and challenging gaming experience.

DESCRIPTION:
•	Designed and implemented a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI agent capable of making strategic moves using the Minimax algorithm.
•	Implemented the Minimax algorithm, a decision-making technique, to enable the AI agent to analyze and choose the optimal moves based on the current game state.
•	Ensured an efficient and optimized game performance to maintain responsiveness during gameplay.

TECHNICAL SKILLS:
•	Programming Languages: Python
•	Algorithms: Minimax Algorithm
•	Game Development

This project reflects my passion for both artificial intelligence and game development, and it demonstrates my ability to create sophisticated algorithms to enhance user experiences. The Tic-Tac-Toe AI agent project showcases my technical skills, creativity, and dedication to delivering high-quality software solutions.
